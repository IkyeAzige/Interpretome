A variable named 'xxx_snp' refers to an object: something more than just an identifier.

A variable named 'xxx_dbsnp' refers to a dbSNP identifier.

We should not use variables named 'xxx_rsid' unless that's definitely going to be an 'rsxxxxx',
or just the 'xxxxx' portion.

Modules should set variables in an object (i.e. {}) on user, instead of many separate
variables right on the window.App.user.
