<h2>Longevity</h2>
There have been documented cases of families where multiple family members become supercentenarians (>110 years old),
suggesting the heritability of extreme longevity.
Various groups have begun to study this phenomenon, attempting to find genetic markers associated with long life.
A recent controversial paper, <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2010/11/10/science.1190532.abstract'>Sebastiani et al</a>,
has identified putative loci linked with extreme longevity.
<br/><br/>
In this exercise, your genotype will be run through the Sebastiani algorithm to estimate your probability of extreme longevity.
The SNPs are ordered by "informativeness" (as defined in the study) and each SNP adjusts your probability of living to 100.
As these results are highly unverified and difficult to generalize to individuals, results should be interpreted with caution.
<strong>Note:</strong> the results from this exercise <i>do not</i> represent your actual probability to living over 100 years old.
