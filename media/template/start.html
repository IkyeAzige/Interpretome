  Load your genome file and choose some of the analyses above.
  Currently, raw data files from 23andme and Lumigenix (unzipped) are supported.

<h3>Interpretome is intended for <i>educational and research purposes only</i>.</h3>
<p>
  No information should be considered diagnostic and as with any genetic testing service, the interpretation is not regulated by the FDA.
  We assume no responsibility for any injury or damage to persons or property arising out of or related to any use of interpretome annotations
  or for any errors or omissions: consult your physician with any medical concerns.

<h3>How is my data kept private?</h3>
<p>
  Your genome will not be sent to any server, it remains on your computer.
  This website will make requests to a database that only contain "rsid" (without genotypes) and "population" (self-reported in the top-right) information.
  At no point will any genotypes be sent across the wires (all computation will be done in the browser).
</p>
<br>
<p>
  Some exercises may have an option to submit personal information, including genotypes or results of analyses.
  Entry of your data is not required and all information will be anonymously stored on a secure server.
  However, there is a theoretical possibility that this information can be intercepted and misused.
  If you are accessing this site on an unecrypted WiFi network, any party may observe the data sent over the connection.
