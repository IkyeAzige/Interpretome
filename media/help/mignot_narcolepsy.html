<h2>Narcolepsy SNPs</h2>
<br/>
Sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy and restless leg syndrome (RLS), have been shown to be heritable and have been linked to genetic variants.
<br/><br/>
In this exercise, we will look up our variants at these loci.
Using a crude odds ratio metric, we can combine these SNPs to find our relative risk for RLS.
Note that since some of these alleles are in the same gene (TCR), they are in high linkage disequilibrium with each other (and therefore, are not independent).
