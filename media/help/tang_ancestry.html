<h2>Ancestry SNPs</h2>
<br/>
As human migration has progressed, genetic drift, as well as selection, has resulted in variable allele frequencies for different populations.
For this reason, genetic variation can be used to infer ancestry.
For more information, explore the "Ancestry" tabs above.

In this exercise, 10 random SNPs were chosen that have different allele frequencies in Europeans and East Asians.
