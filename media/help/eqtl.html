<h2>eQTLs</h2>
<br/>
As with any quantitative trait, genetic variants can be associated with expression of nearby genes.
These variants are known as expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs):
the presence of one allele may suggest higher expression of an associated gene than the other allele.

In this exercise, you can explore the eQTLs in your personal genotype.
