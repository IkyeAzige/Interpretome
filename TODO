PCA:
//
While using Interpretome I noticed that in the PCA there are some related reference samples who take up dimensions. Could you please remove all relatives out of the reference data so we can have more informative dimensions? For the HGDP dataset try following the recommendations of Rosenberg, there are also a few mislabeled samples in HGDP namely a Biaka Pygmy sample (HGDP00980) who is likely European and a Japanese sample (HGDP00770) who is likely Native American. They mess up the HGDP African and HGDP Asian plots. For the other datasets try removing all related samples with PI_HAT > 0.5 in PLINK.

- Is it possible somehow to get the mean “distance” between my plot point and the plot points of the persons originating from country XX?
- I would like to get a list with one row for each country with that very mean distance.

I'm wondering if you might have in mind any plans to refine the PCA analysis so that specific regions of a person's genome can be focussed on? For instance, rather than processing the whole genome, can I focus in on part of Chromosome 8 where I suspect there might be some admixture?

- Indeed, it'd be wonderful if the Interpretome team could at some point put together a seven-way test, based on relatively unmixed samples from Northern Europe, Southern Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, the Americas and Africa. They could do this by combining samples from the HGDP, Behar et al., and even Rasmussen et al. As far as I can see, it should be possible.

Best so far (fauxdk https://www.23andme.com/you/community/thread/8090/):
40 SNPs 
10 Smoothing 
35 or above Samples
