  This website will make requests to a database that only contain "rsid" (without genotypes) and "population" (self-reported in the top-right) information.
  At no point will any genotypes be sent across the wires (all computation will be done in the browser).

  Some exercises may have an option to submit personal information, including genotypes or results of analyses.
  Entry of your data is not required and all information will be anonymously stored on a secure server.
  However, there is a theoretical possibility that this information can be intercepted and misused.
