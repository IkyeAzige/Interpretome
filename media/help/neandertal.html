<h2>Neandertal</h2>
Recent evidence has suggested that humans may have interbred with Neandertals after their migration out of Africa.
With the <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/710.abstract'>sequencing of the Neandertal genome</a>,
variants have been found in Neandertals and Europeans and Asians, but not Africans.

In this exercise, you can count the number of Neandertal alleles in your personal genotype.
Note that this index is not an actual measure of your physical similarity to a Neandertal.
