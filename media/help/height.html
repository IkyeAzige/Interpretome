<h2>About Height Prediction</h2>
Height is a classic example of a "missing heritability" trait:
it is known to be associated with genetic factors (approximately 75% heritable),
but thus far, association studies have only been able to

In this exercise, we will attempt to predict your height based on 145 SNPs and compare this to a similar prediction based on the height of your parents.
