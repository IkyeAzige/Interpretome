<h2>Binding SNPs</h2>
<br/>
About <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5975/232.abstract'>7.5% of transcription factor binding sites</a> vary among individuals
and a portion of these can be attributable to single nucleotide genetic variants.

In this exercise, you can impute your level of NFkB binding at various loci.
The resulting number is the average binding level for cell lines with the same genotype.
