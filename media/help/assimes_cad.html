<h2>CAD SNPs</h2>
<br/>
As in the exercise from Dr. Euan Ashley, various genetic variants have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD).
<br/><br/>
In this exercise, we will examine a different set of alleles associated with coronary artery disease.
Again, note that this is not an exhaustive list of variants,
nor is the total number of risk alleles an official indicator of developing CAD.
These variants are purely for educational and research purposes only.
