<h2>Coronary Artery Disease SNPs</h2>
<br/>
Many genetic variants have been associated with Coronary Artery Disease,
a common disease that affects millions of patients worldwide.
<br/><br/>
In this exercise, we will explore a set of variants associated with CAD.
Note that this is not an exhaustive list of variants,
nor is the total number of risk alleles an official indicator of developing CAD.
These variants are purely for educational and research purposes only.
