<h2>Diabetes SNPs</h2>
<br/>
Type 2 Diabetes is one of the canonical examples of a common disease with a heritable genetic component.
Recent publications have implicated a number of genetic loci with diabetes,
but the effect sizes (odds ratio) are modest and the sum of these has not been able to explain the heritable component.

In this exercise, we will explore our variants at the sites discovered by a few studies.
As with any exercise, these variants are not diagnostic
and the number of alleles can not be used as an official indicator of diabetes.
