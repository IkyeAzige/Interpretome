<h3>Positive selection</h3>
<p>
This exercise looks up your genotype at one of 200 positions in the human genome thought to be 
under recent positive selection.  
When a new mutation appears that has a selective advantage, it can have a very rapid rise in the 
population before recombination can occur with nearby linked SNPs.  
The result is that there is a long region of the chromosome with one haplotype.  
Two methods (long range haplotype and integrated haplotype score) have been developed to search 
for long haplotypes, indicative of recent positive selection.

The table appears from Sabeti et al., 
&quot;Genome-wide detection and characterization of positive selection in human populations.&quot;
Nature. 2007 Oct 18;449(7164):913-8.  
When you input your information, the application searches for haplotypes in your population 
under positive selection.  
The table lists one of the SNPs in the haplotype with positive selection, 
which is linked to the new mutation conferring selection.  
The listed SNP could have the ancestral or derived allele, depending on its state on the 
chromosome in which the new mutation occurred.

<p>
The table lists: <br />
<strong>dbSNP:</strong> identity of the SNP
<br />
<strong>Genotype:</strong> your genotype
<br />
<strong>Ancestral:</strong> the ancestral allele 
<br />
<strong>Selected:</strong> the allele on the long range haplotype that is under positive selection. 
<br />
<strong>Genes</strong>: nearby genes
<br />
<strong>Imputed from</strong>: the SNP used for imputation
<br />
<strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong>: the variance between the snp and the imputed SNP
